# What is this?
This is a site I use to document some of the things I am currently working on. My name is Alejandro, I'm from Argentina and I have more than 10 years of experience working on databases and data processing. Long time ago there was no Big Data, no Machine Learning and very little widely used flavors of NoSQL. Things have changed a lot in the last few years and I would like to share what I have learned to help others (and also to help my future self when I forget how to do some of this stuff)

## Who is this site for?
For developers or people learning from everywhere. I'll divide the content by flavor of NoSQL, ML or Big Data. You won't find content about web development or so, maybe a bit about how to build APIs. As I keep adding content, a basic list with the links will be added below.

If you have doubts or questions, you can contact me through [github](https://github.com/alexsem) or through Twitter in [@AlejandroSempri](https://twitter.com/AlejandroSempri) (I speak Spanish and English).
