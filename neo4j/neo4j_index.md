# Graph databases are cool
When we talk about Graph databases, Neo4j is the king. It is the most widely used graph database so far based on [db-engines](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/graph+dbms).

But, what is a graph? Graphs are actually a mathematical concept created by Euler. If you have studied graphs in college or school, you are probably familiar (or at leas have heard of) the problem of the Koninsberg bridges. Let's take a look at the following image:

The short story goes around like this: _"Let's say I have a carriage (or a car to make it more up to date). Is there a way in which, starting from any piece of land, I can go through each bridge only once and finish where I started?"_

The short answer, is that no, it isn't possible. But why? Let's imagine each piece of land as a circle and each bridge as an arrow linking these circles. The result would be like this:
